    <h2>What Makes Culver’s ButterBurger So Special?</h2>
    <p>Let’s start with the basics: what exactly is a ButterBurger? Contrary to what the name might suggest, it’s not a burger made entirely of butter (though that does sound intriguing). Instead, the ButterBurger gets its name from the lightly buttered, toasted bun that cradles the juicy beef patty. This simple yet genius touch elevates the burger to a whole new level of deliciousness.</p>
    <p>Culver’s takes pride in using fresh, never frozen, Midwest-raised beef for their patties. This commitment to quality ensures that every bite is packed with flavor. Add to that a selection of fresh toppings, melty cheese, and Culver’s signature sauces, and you’ve got a burger that’s hard to beat.</p>

    <h2>Exploring the ButterBurger Menu</h2>
    <p>Culver’s offers a variety of ButterBurger options to suit every appetite. Whether you’re in the mood for a classic single or ready to tackle a triple, there’s something for everyone. Let’s break down the menu and highlight the positive points of each option.</p>

    <h3>1. Single ButterBurger</h3>
    <p>The Single ButterBurger is perfect for those who want a satisfying meal without overdoing it. It features one juicy beef patty, topped with your choice of cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and Culver’s signature mayo. The lightly buttered bun adds a touch of richness that ties everything together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Price:</strong> Affordable and budget-friendly, the Single ButterBurger is a great value for the quality you’re getting.</li>
      <li><strong>Calories:</strong> At around 390-490 calories (depending on toppings), it’s a reasonable choice for a hearty meal.</li>
      <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Fresh, high-quality ingredients make this burger a standout.</li>
      <li><strong>Allergens:</strong> Culver’s provides detailed allergen information, so you can customize your order to suit your dietary needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Double ButterBurger</h3>
    <p>If you’re feeling a bit hungrier, the Double ButterBurger is the way to go. With two beef patties, this burger doubles the flavor and satisfaction. It’s a favorite among Culver’s regulars and for good reason.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Price:</strong> Slightly higher than the Single, but still a great deal for the amount of food you’re getting.</li>
      <li><strong>Calories:</strong> Around 590-690 calories, making it a filling option for lunch or dinner.</li>
      <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> The same fresh, high-quality ingredients as the Single, but with an extra patty for added indulgence.</li>
      <li><strong>Allergens:</strong> Customizable to accommodate various dietary restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Triple ButterBurger</h3>
    <p>For the ultimate burger experience, the Triple ButterBurger is a must-try. With three beef patties, this burger is not for the faint of heart—but it’s absolutely worth it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Price:</strong> The most expensive of the three, but still a great value for the sheer amount of food.</li>
      <li><strong>Calories:</strong> Around 790-890 calories, making it a hearty meal that will keep you full for hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> All the same fresh ingredients, but with even more beefy goodness.</li>
      <li><strong>Allergens:</strong> As always, Culver’s makes it easy to customize your order to avoid allergens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Culver’s ButterBurgers Stand Out</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Freshness You Can Taste:</strong> Culver’s commitment to using fresh, never frozen beef is a game-changer. You can taste the difference in every bite.</li>
      <li><strong>Customizable Toppings:</strong> One of the best things about Culver’s is the ability to customize your burger to your liking.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single ButterBurger:</strong> Perfect for a light meal or snack. It’s satisfying without being overly indulgent.</li>
